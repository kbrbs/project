# üìß Email Configuration Guide for Sending Temporary Passwords

## Overview
Your Django project is now configured to send **real emails** using Gmail's SMTP server. Temporary passwords will be sent to users' registered email addresses during signup.

## üîê Step 1: Generate a Gmail App Password

Since Gmail requires 2-Step Verification for app access, you need to create an **App Password**:

### Instructions:

1. **Enable 2-Step Verification** (if not already enabled):
   - Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/security
   - Under "How you sign in to Google", click **2-Step Verification**
   - Follow the prompts to enable it

2. **Generate an App Password**:
   - Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
   - Select app: **Mail**
   - Select device: **Windows Computer** (or other)
   - Click **Generate**
   - Copy the 16-character password (it looks like: `xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx`)

3. **Save this password** - you'll need it in the next step!

## ‚öôÔ∏è Step 2: Set Environment Variable (Windows PowerShell)

To securely store your App Password, set it as an environment variable:

### Option A: Set for Current PowerShell Session (Temporary)
```powershell
$env:SMTP_PASSWORD = "your-16-character-app-password"
```

### Option B: Set System-Wide (Permanent)
```powershell
# Run PowerShell as Administrator, then:
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('SMTP_PASSWORD', 'your-16-character-app-password', 'User')
```

**Replace** `your-16-character-app-password` with the actual App Password from Step 1.

---

## ‚úÖ Step 3: Verify Configuration

After setting the environment variable, restart your Django server:

```powershell
python manage.py runserver
```

Then test email sending by:
1. Creating a new user account via the signup page
2. Check the registered email inbox for the temporary password
3. You should receive an email with subject: **"Your Temporary Password"**

---

## üß™ Step 4: Test Email in Python Console (Optional)

You can test email sending directly:

```powershell
python manage.py shell
```

Then run:
```python
from django.core.mail import send_mail

send_mail(
    'Test Email',
    'This is a test message from your Django app!',
    'katrinamicaellabarbosa@gmail.com',  # From email
    ['recipient@example.com'],  # To email (use your real email)
    fail_silently=False,
)
```

If successful, you'll see `1` returned, and the email will arrive!

---

## üîß Current Settings (in settings.py)

```python
EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend'
EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.gmail.com'
EMAIL_PORT = 587
EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'katrinamicaellabarbosa@gmail.com'
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = os.environ.get('SMTP_PASSWORD', '')  # From environment variable
EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = 'katrinamicaellabarbosa@gmail.com'
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Issue: "SMTPAuthenticationError: Username and Password not accepted"
**Solution**: 
- Make sure you're using the **App Password**, not your regular Gmail password
- Verify 2-Step Verification is enabled
- Check that the environment variable is set correctly

### Issue: Email not received
**Solution**:
- Check spam/junk folder
- Verify the recipient email is correct
- Check server logs for errors

### Issue: "SMTPServerDisconnected: Connection unexpectedly closed"
**Solution**:
- Check your internet connection
- Gmail might be temporarily blocking. Wait a few minutes and try again

## üîí Security Notes

- **Never commit** your App Password to Git
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- The App Password is specific to this application
- You can revoke it anytime at: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords

## üìù How It Works Now

### Signup Flow:
1. User fills signup form with email, username, password, etc.
2. Django creates user account
3. **Temporary password is generated** (random 8-character string)
4. **Email is sent** to the registered email address with the temp password
5. User receives email and can login with temporary password
6. User is prompted to **change password** on first login
7. After changing password, user is redirected to **Dashboard**

### Email Template:
```
Subject: Your Temporary Password

Hello [username],

Your account has been created successfully!

Your temporary password is: [8-character-code]

Please log in at http://127.0.0.1:8000/login/ and change your password immediately.

Thank you!
```
